# Shiny App for Happy Valley Meat Company

Authors: Xinrui Chen, Fei Zhang, Yiwen Wang

## Introduction and Background

Our client Happy Valley Meat (HVM) Company wants a shiny app where their customers will input the weight of meat and the cuts of meat that they are interested in comparing for purchase. The shiny app will output tables and plots to show the environmental impact of the weight of meat for each cut. The environmental impact report will include the water usage, carbon dioxide emissions, land usage, and
number of animals required for that amount of each cut. The idea is to persuade customers to make choices with less environmental impact; for example, instead of buying 100 pounds of hangar steak which requires 67 animals, could they instead buy 100 pounds of tenderloin which would only require 10 animals?


## Explanation for our app

Our app can be found [Here](https://xinruichen.shinyapps.io/happyvalleymeat/).

### Overview

In this part, an overview of all environmental impacts for each cut of meat is provided. Therefore customers can look at all data separately.

### Environmental Impact

In this part, we provide the opportunity for customers to select their own weights for different environmental impacts which are water usage, land usage and carbon dioxide emission, and the weight of meat. Then we calculate and visualize the overall environmental impact score for each cut of meat. Therefore, customers can gain an overall idea of the environmental impact for each cut of meat.

### Comparison

In this part, we compare the environmental impact for different types of food considering the same amount of protein or calories consumed. We desire to persuade customers to buy other types of food instead of meat.
